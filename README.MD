* I have create what needed to be done, but I have a little problem:

    -   When it's in the responsive 50% it's showing a huge blue background in the bottom,
        and in 75% just a tiny blue background in the bottom (which is not part of the model photo).
        But if I have it in the 100% its fine. 
        
    +   It's working fine if I choose Tablet's, Mobile Phone's and Desktop.
